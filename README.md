Uber Ride Cancellation Analysis: Data-Driven Insights
An end-to-end analysis revealing that 25% of Uber rides fail to complete, with only 93,000 of 150,000 bookings successful. Using Python for data cleaning and SQL for analysis, the project identifies driver cancellations as the primary issue (27,000 rides vs. 10,500 customer cancellations).


Key Findings:

- Cancellations are operational, not seasonal (consistent 22-26% across months/hours)
- Critical vulnerability: 5-10 minute wait times show 30%+ cancellation rates
- Monday peaks at 25.7% cancellations; 5 AM is the worst hour
- All vehicle types underperform consistently (24-27% range)

Actionable Recommendations:

- Reducing wait times below 5 minutes could cut cancellations by 33%. 
- Addressing top driver cancellation reasons (customer issues, sick passengers, car problems) would recover thousands of monthly rides. 
- The dashboard provides clear intervention points for immediate operational improvement.
